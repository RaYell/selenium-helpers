# Description

Extensions for Selenium WebDriver including jQuery selector support for `FindElement` and `FindElements` methods.

# Installation

Run the following command in Visual Studio Packet Manager Console.
```posh
Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver.Extensions
```

# Usage
#### Include extensions
Include extensions namespace and set the derived `By` to be used.
```csharp
using Selenium.WebDriver.Extensions;
using By = Selenium.WebDriver.Extensions.By;
```

#### Basic example
Invoke jQuery selectors on the WebDriver.
```csharp
var driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.FindElements(By.JQuerySelector("input:visible"))
```

#### Chaining
You can also chain jQuery traversing methods.
```csharp
var driver = new ChromeDriver();
var selector = By.JQuerySelector("div.myclass").Parents(".someClass").NextAll();
driver.FindElement(selector);
```

#### jQuery loading
If the site that you are testing with Selenium does not include jQuery this extension will automatically load the latest version when you run `FindElement` or `FindElements` method. If you want you can choose to load a different version of jQuery.

```csharp
var driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.LoadJQuery("1.11.0");
```

#### jQuery variable name
When you create a jQuery selector using By helper class the resulting selector will use jQuery as library variable. If you site is using a different variable name for this purpose you can also customize this behavior.

```csharp
var driver = new ChromeDriver();
var selector = By.JQuerySelector("div", jQueryVariable: "myJQuery");
```

#### jQuery context switch
Last but not least, you can use one `JQuerySelector` as a context of another `JQuerySelector`.

```csharp
var driver = new ChromeDriver();
var context = By.JQuerySelector("div.myClass");
var selector = By.JQuerySelector("ol li", context);
driver.FindElements(selector);
```

# Known Issues
 
Only the basic traversing methods are implemented. This means that only string selectors will work. Also methods like `.map()` or `.each()` are not implemented. You also cannot use JavaScript functions which can be accepted as parameters to some of the methods.
