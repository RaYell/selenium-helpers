# Description
Extensions for Selenium WebDriver.

# Features
* jQuery support
 * jQuery selectors support for Selenium WebDriver to perform DOM-element selections that CSS can't do
 * jQuery auto-load on pages on sites that don't use jQuery
 * Supports jQuery context switching
 * Supports all jQuery traversing methods for generation of complex selector chains
* Sizzle support
 * Sizzle selectors support for Selenium WebDriver to perform DOM-element selections that CSS can't do
 * Sizzle auto-load on pages on sites that don't use Sizzle
 * Supports Sizzle context switching
* Query selector support
 * Query selector support for Selenium WebDriver to easily invoke queries in modern browsers
 * Query selector support detection
* Other
 * Very easy setup: install packages with NuGet, include a namespace and start using it with your existing Selenium solution
 * High quality ensured by continous integration setup with Appveyor, unit and integration tests and 100% code coverage
 * Well documented code following strict StyleCop and FxCop rules

# Installation
Run the following command in Visual Studio Package Manager Console.
```posh
Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver.Extensions
```

This will install the full package containing jQuery, Sizzle and query selector support. If you want to use only specific extensions you can do this by installing a specific package in Package Manager Console.

```posh
Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver.Extensions.JQuery
Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver.Extensions.Sizzle
Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver.Extensions.QuerySelector
```

# Documentation
API documentation can be found [here](https://rayell.github.io/selenium-webdriver-extensions/api).

# Usage

#### Include extensions
Include extensions namespace and set the derived `By` to be used.
```csharp
using Selenium.WebDriver.Extensions;
using By = Selenium.WebDriver.Extensions.By;
```

If you have installed support for just some of the extensions you need to adjust the namespace of the `By` type accordingly.

```csharp
using Selenium.WebDriver.Extensions.JQuery;
using By = Selenium.WebDriver.Extensions.JQuery.By;
```

#### Basic jQuery example
Invoke jQuery selectors on the WebDriver.
```csharp
driver.FindElements(By.JQuerySelector("input:visible"))
```

#### Chaining jQuery methods
You can also chain jQuery traversing methods.
```csharp
var selector = By.JQuerySelector("div.myclass").Parents(".someClass").NextAll();
driver.FindElement(selector);
```

#### jQuery loading
If the site that you are testing with Selenium does not include jQuery this extension will automatically load the latest version when you run any of the `Find*` methods. If you want you can choose to load a different version of jQuery. The library uses jQuery CDN by default, but if you want to use a completely different source, that's also supported

```csharp
driver.JQuery().Load("1.11.0"); // load specific version from default CDN
driver.JQuery().Load(new Uri("http://some.server/jquery.js")); // load a library from other source
```

#### jQuery variable name
When you create a jQuery selector using `By` helper class the resulting selector will use `jQuery` as library variable name. If you site is using a different variable name for this purpose you can pass this value as an optional parameter.

```csharp
var selector = By.JQuerySelector("div", jQueryVariable: "myJQuery");
```

#### jQuery context switch
You can use one `JQuerySelector` instance as a context of another `JQuerySelector`.

```csharp
var context = By.JQuerySelector("div.myClass");
var selector = By.JQuerySelector("ol li", context);
driver.FindElements(selector);
```

#### jQuery helper methods
You can have instant access to values of the getter jQuery methods.

```csharp
var value = driver.JQuery(By.JQuerySelector("input")).Value();
```

#### Basic Sizzle example
Invoke Sizzle selectors on the WebDriver.
```csharp
driver.FindElements(By.SizzleSelector("input:visible"))
```

#### Sizzle loading
If the site that you are testing with Selenium does not include Sizzle this extension will automatically load the 2.0.0 version when you run any of the `Find*` methods. If you want you can choose to load a different version of Sizzle. The library used CloudFlare CDN by default, but if you want to use a completely different source, that's also supported

```csharp
driver.Sizzle().Load("1.11.1"); // load specific version from default CDN
driver.Sizzle().Load(new Uri("http://some.server/sizzle.js")); // load a library from other source
```

#### Sizzle context switch
You can use one `SizzleSelector` instance as a context of another `SizzleSelector`. Contrary to jQuery equivalent of this method, only first element from the context is used. This is because it's a limitation of Sizzle.

```csharp
var context = By.SizzleSelector("div.myClass");
var selector = By.SizzleSelector("ol li", context);
driver.FindElements(selector);
```

#### Basic query selector example
Invoke query selectors on the WebDriver.
```csharp
driver.FindElements(By.QuerySelector("div input"))
```
